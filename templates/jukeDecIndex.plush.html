  Jukebox, Decentralized: Jukedec will incorporate a set of services that allow for an end-user to queue up songs on an internet radio stream by paying in SLP tokens. The payment then gets distributed, with half of it going to the artist, and the rest paying infrastructure costs. The library of audio is built from scratch, with the artists incentivized to upload their content to a federated system of independantly-run content servers through ease of use.

          This site, as it stands, is a proof of concept. In the future, I hope to create software that allows for a system of federated (distributed) instances of inndependantly owned servers just like this one, that would allow artists and collectives more control over their art, and actually get paid for it.
